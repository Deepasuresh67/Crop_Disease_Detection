# 🌾 Crop Disease Detection 🚜  
**Detect crop diseases and check weather conditions effortlessly using deep learning and an intuitive web interface!**

---

## 🌟 **Overview**  
Welcome to the **Crop Disease Detection project!** This Django-based web application allows users to detect crop diseases by uploading an image or providing an image URL. It leverages a **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model** for predictions and includes additional features like weather updates for user convenience.

## 🌟 Features  

- **Upload Images** 📷: Upload a crop image to analyze for diseases.  
- **Predict Diseases** 🔍: Powered by TensorFlow Lite for accurate predictions with confidence levels.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  

- **Backend**: Django, Python  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow Lite  
- **Database**: SQLite

## 🔬 How It Works  

1. **Upload IMG **: Use the interface to upload a crop image.  
2. **Model Prediction**: The uploaded image is resized, normalized, and passed to a TensorFlow Lite model for disease detection.  
3. **Get Results**: View the predicted disease name and confidence percentage.
